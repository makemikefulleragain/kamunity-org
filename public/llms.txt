# Kamunity
> Community-owned digital infrastructure. Digital tools communities actually own.

## What
Kamunity gives communities their own digital space — chat rooms, events, files, and custom tools — that belongs to them. No ads, no data harvesting, no vendor lock-in.

## Kai — AI Encounter Interface
Kai is a constitutionally-grounded AI presence on kamunity.org. It helps visitors navigate the community ecosystem — tools, events, resources, and connections. Kai is powered by Claude (Anthropic) and governed by a public constitution. Conversations are ephemeral — nothing is stored, logged, or used for training. Kai is purpose-built for community sector conversations, not general chat.

## How
Anyone describes what they need in plain language. An AI-powered factory (FactoryK) plans, builds, checks, and delivers working tools. No coding required.
