# Kamunity
> Community-owned digital infrastructure. Digital tools communities actually own.

## What
Kamunity gives communities their own digital space — chat rooms, events, files, and custom tools — that belongs to them. No ads, no data harvesting, no vendor lock-in.

## How
Anyone describes what they need in plain language. An AI-powered factory (FactoryK) plans, builds, checks, and delivers working tools. No coding required.

## Live Tools

## Values
Sovereignty, Accessibility, Joy, Sustainability, Agency. No surveillance. No dark patterns. Constitution-enforced.

## Built in Perth, Western Australia
