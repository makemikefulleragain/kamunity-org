# Kamunity — Full Context
> Community-owned digital infrastructure. Digital tools communities actually own.

## What is Kamunity?
Kamunity is a platform that gives communities their own digital space — chat rooms, events, files, and custom tools — that belongs to them. No ads, no data harvesting, no vendor lock-in. Built in Perth, Western Australia, for community organisations, nonprofits, students, and people doing it tough.

## The Problem Kamunity Solves
Community groups rely on Facebook, WhatsApp, Google Docs, and expensive SaaS platforms they don't own. Members' data gets harvested. Free plans shrink. Paid plans grow. When you leave, you leave empty-handed. Kamunity changes that — your community gets its own space, its own tools, and keeps its own data.

## How It Works
1. Your own space: Your community gets its own Kamunity instance — your database, your domain, your rules.
2. Tools built for you: Describe what you need in plain English. An AI-powered factory (FactoryK) plans, builds, checks, and delivers working tools. No coding. No consultants.
3. Connected, not dependent: Built on ActivityPub (same tech as Mastodon). Find other communities. Share what you choose. Your data stays on your server.
4. AI that works with you: Kai helps organise, summarise, and suggest — but never decides for you. An assistant, not a boss.

## The Factory (FactoryK)
FactoryK is the community-owned build system. When someone speaks a need at the campfire (Kamunity.Ai), the factory listens, plans, builds, checks its own work, and delivers something that actually runs. It has constitutional guardrails — no surveillance, no dark patterns, no vendor lock-in, no extracting data without knowledge. The values are structural, not aspirational.

## Constitution
Kamunity operates under a community-written constitution. No tracking, no cookies, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, high performance. The infrastructure enforces the values — a request to build a surveillance tool gets refused by the system itself, not by a person making a judgement call.

## Location
Perth, Western Australia. 11% of Western Australians experience digital exclusion. Kamunity exists to close that gap.
