# Kamunity — Full Context
> Community-owned digital infrastructure. Free tools communities actually own.

## What is Kamunity?
Kamunity is a platform that gives communities their own digital space — chat, events, files, tools — that belongs to them. Built in Perth, Western Australia.

## Core Values
- Sovereignty: Your data is yours. Portable. Deletable. Never sold.
- Accessibility: If a teenager can't use it, it's not finished.
- Joy: Community tools should feel good, not grey.
- Sustainability: No single point of failure. Ever.
- Agency: With you, not for you.
