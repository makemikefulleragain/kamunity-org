# Kamunity — Full Context
> Community-owned digital infrastructure. Digital tools communities actually own.

## What is Kamunity?
Kamunity is a platform that gives communities their own digital space — chat rooms, events, files, and custom tools — that belongs to them. No ads, no data harvesting, no vendor lock-in. Built in Perth, Western Australia, for community organisations, nonprofits, students, and people doing it tough.

## Kai — AI Encounter Interface
Kai is the default landing experience on kamunity.org. It is a constitutionally-grounded AI encounter interface that helps visitors navigate the Kamunity ecosystem — connecting people with tools, events, resources, and humans.

Key facts about Kai:
- Powered by Claude (Anthropic's Claude Sonnet model) via server-side API
- Governed by a public constitution (readable at /constitution) with an amendment mechanism
- Conversations are 100% ephemeral — nothing is stored, logged, tracked, or used for AI training
- Purpose-built for Australian community sector conversations (NFPs, social services, digital inclusion)
- Surfaces contextual resource cards (links to tools, events, contacts) based on conversation
- Includes a desktop slide-out resources panel and mobile inline cards
- Gently redirects off-topic queries (e.g. homework) back to community focus
- Not a professional advisor — always directs to humans for important decisions
- Zero data collection: no cookies, no analytics, no tracking, no accounts
- API key is server-side only, never exposed to the client
- Built with Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, Fraunces + DM Sans fonts

Kai's encounter principles:
1. Arrive before being asked — open with what's alive in the network
2. Witness before solving — acknowledge before offering tools
3. Surface, don't direct — offer options, never prescribe
4. Meet people where they are — adapt language and depth
5. Connect to humans — success is when Kai becomes unnecessary
6. Plain language — the "9th grader test"
7. Ontological honesty — Kai is an AI and says so
8. Cultural safety — humility with Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, and CALD communities
9. Respect silence — warm but not wordy

## The Problem Kamunity Solves
Community groups rely on Facebook, WhatsApp, Google Docs, and expensive SaaS platforms they don't own. Members' data gets harvested. Free plans shrink. Paid plans grow. When you leave, you leave empty-handed. Kamunity changes that — your community gets its own space, its own tools, and keeps its own data.

## How It Works
1. Your own space: Your community gets its own Kamunity instance — your database, your domain, your rules.
2. Tools built for you: Describe what you need in plain English. An AI-powered factory (FactoryK) plans, builds, checks, and delivers working tools. No coding. No consultants.
3. Connected, not dependent: Built on ActivityPub (same tech as Mastodon). Find other communities. Share what you choose. Your data stays on your server.
4. AI that works with you: Kai helps organise, summarise, and suggest — but never decides for you. An assistant, not a boss.

## The Factory (FactoryK)
FactoryK is the community-owned build system. When someone speaks a need at the campfire (Kamunity.Ai), the factory listens, plans, builds, checks its own work, and delivers something that actually runs. It has constitutional guardrails — no surveillance, no dark patterns, no vendor lock-in, no extracting data without knowledge. The values are structural, not aspirational.

## Constitution
Kamunity operates under a community-written constitution. No tracking, no cookies, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, high performance. The infrastructure enforces the values — a request to build a surveillance tool gets refused by the system itself, not by a person making a judgement call. Kai's constitution is a separate document governing AI behaviour, also publicly readable and amendable.

## Security & Privacy
- Zero data collection: no cookies, no analytics, no tracking pixels, no fingerprinting
- No user accounts or sign-ups required
- Kai conversations exist only in the browser session — server retains nothing
- Anthropic API used in non-training mode — user data is not used to train models
- API keys are server-side only, never exposed to the browser
- No third-party scripts (no Google Analytics, Facebook pixels, etc.)
- All external links clearly marked; each external site has its own terms

## Location
Perth, Western Australia. 11% of Western Australians experience digital exclusion. Kamunity exists to close that gap.
